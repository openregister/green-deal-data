[Data](https://github.com/openregister/green-deal-data/blob/master/data/)
for the green-deal registers.

## Participant export

Most of the data for assessors, providers and installers can be
[exported](http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/green-deal-participant-register/participant-export)
from the website in csv files.

## assessors

Green Deal assessors are responsible for assessing properties that want to apply
for support from Green Deal to make their home more energy efficient. You can
find out more about their role at: http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/assessors

There is a list of all certified assessors on the ORB website:
http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/find-a-green-deal-supplier?DECC=true

- contact details (companies)
- whether the assessor is for domestic or non-domestic properties.

## providers

Green Deal Providers arrange Green Deal Plans, provide finance, and arrange for
the installation of the agreed energy efficiency improvements through an
authorised Installer. See http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/providers

Mainly a list of companies with contact details.

## installers

Once a property has had an assessment and the finance for measures has been
approved, the next step will be installation of the Green Deal measure(s)
agreed. Only an authorised Green Deal Installer can install energy efficiency
improvements under the Green Deal finance mechanism. Installers may specialise
in one or multiple measures.

## certified bodies

The Certification Bodies register displays companies which have been UKAS
accredited for the certification of installation and advisory services under the
Green Deal. See: http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/certification-body-search

Might not need to be its own register, because it seems to be a subset of the
Green Deal installers, so it might be able to be combined with that register or
link to it.
